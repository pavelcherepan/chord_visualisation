# Chord visualizer

Use to create a diagram of all variations of a guitar chord from a given string.

# Usage

Run `main` function in the `main.py` and provide a string of a chord to be displayed
and a `plot` argument of how different variants should be displayed.

If an integer is provided then only the plot with that integer index will be displayed. 
If 'all' then all variants will be shown on a large plot. If 'one-by-one'
then the script will display plots one by one in the order of the index.
